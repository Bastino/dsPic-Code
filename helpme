This is where you will post your question and one of the team member will dump a code
in the dsPic-Code with your name as the subject of the file.

Example: 

Boitumelo 

How do I commit changes on Github?

Someone's answer:
google how to commit changes on Github > this should be saved as

how-to-commit-Boitumelo.txt inside dsPic-Code

Hope this helps for all our sake

:)
