Programming in C


In this folder we will be coding the control of motors -- Stepper motors

1. Development of a PWM 
    algorithm and code of 100% - 75% - 50% - 25% - 0%

2. Stepper motor control 
    Pin connections
    Control 360° --- 180°  --- 90° 
    How to control the motor speed applying the code and algorithm provided under a PWM code

3. Servomotors
   This will pretty much follow the algorithm of PWM implemented to control the servo speed
     a. Jerk - rapid movement
     b. variable speed -- applying a 50% PWM

4. Ultrasonic sensor code
   The algorithm development under this section is mostly used to facilitate the control of
   a robot or system under implementation

5. Other peripherals and help should be written inside this file
   file / HELP/ helpme.txt
